Generate images of attractors of any IFS in one, two or three dimensions.

To use download the files and run IFSGen.py. A separate window will open which offers customisation in terms of dimensions, number of maps and precision. 

Different maps can be chosen, each row corresponds to one function with the columns representing the values of the function taken in that coordindate. For instance the first map input represents the first map's x-coordinate. 

Choosing precision to be roughly 10000 seems to be optimal in terms of time to run and quality of image.
